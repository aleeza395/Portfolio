          <p>Hi! I'm Aleeza Zahid, a CS student, recently completed my 4th semester and web developer with 1.5 years of learning how to build interactive websites using React, Node.js, and more.</p>
        <p>My coding journey began with small games and soon evolved into full-stack web applications. I love solving problems, crafting clean UIs, and learning new tech.</p>
        <p>Other than Web Development, I also run a small business of paintings and handicrafted jewelery named Canvas.and.craft</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities where I can grow as a developer and contribute to real-world projects.</p>
